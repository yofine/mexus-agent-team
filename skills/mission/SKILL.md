# `/mexus-team:mission`

Use this skill when the user invokes `/mexus-team:mission "<request>"`.

This skill **only creates a new Mission**. To continue an already-active Mission, use `/mexus-team:continue` instead. A `<request>` argument is required.

This is a standalone Agent Team workflow. It must not call `mexus`, create panes, use Mission Inbox, or rely on external A2A messaging. Communication happens through `agent-team/` Markdown files, especially `kanban.md`.

Starting a Mission makes it the only active Mission in the workspace. Any previous active Mission is archived by changing its `mission.md` lifecycle to `Lifecycle: archived`.

## Create The Mission

1. Preserve the user's request.
2. Choose a Mission name from `--name` or derive a short slug.
3. Run the standalone script from this plugin:

   ```bash
   node <plugin-root>/scripts/start-mission.mjs --root "$PWD" --name <mission-name> --request "<request>"
   ```

4. Read:
   - `agent-team/mission-workflow.md`
   - `agent-team/missions/<mission-name>/mission.md`
   - `agent-team/missions/<mission-name>/agents.md`
   - `agent-team/missions/<mission-name>/kanban.md`
   - `agent-team/missions/<mission-name>/roundtable.md`
5. Act as Squad Lead.
6. Refine the generated `agents.md` and `kanban.md` so the Mission has the right execution Agents and actionable worker tasks.

## Then Start The Board

7. After the roster and kanban are planned, start (or reuse) the read-only board so the user can watch execution:

   ```bash
   node <plugin-root>/scripts/start-board.mjs --root "$PWD" --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

   The script reuses a board that is already running for this project and only prints its URL; it starts a fresh board only when none is alive. Print the board URL to the user.

## Then Execute

8. Use the Agent tool to start Claude Code or Codex background Agents in parallel for the independent kanban tasks planned in step 6.
9. Within this same session, Squad Lead keeps coordinating: when an Agent finishes, reports a blocker, or a new actionable task appears in `kanban.md`, Squad Lead dispatches the next background Agents itself. The user does not run a command for in-session follow-up; `/mexus-team:continue` is only for resuming a Mission in a later session.

## Execution Rules

- `Squad Lead` is a fixed coordination role name. Do not rename it, and do not consume one of the execution Agent names for Squad Lead.
- Squad Lead decomposition work is not a kanban task. `/mexus-team:mission` must finish with a planned roster, planned kanban tasks, a running board, and the first background Agents dispatched.
- Treat `agent-team/agents.md` as the long-term repository roster. Reuse existing Agents when their module history fits, and add new Agents only when no close owner exists.
- Use Claude Code or Codex background Agents for worker execution.
- Every execution Agent must be named according to `agent-team-mission-workflow`: short stable names drawn at random from the Ars Goetia / Lesser Key of Solomon name set, never sequential placeholders. A name must not repeat another Agent in this Mission or in `agent-team/agents.md`.
- Do not use external A2A, inbox, pane dispatch, or Mexus runtime features.
- Kanban is the communication protocol.
- Kanban task `From` must be Squad Lead or an executing Agent, never `User`.
- Dispatch one scoped task per background Agent.
- The executing background Agent, not the Squad Lead, must move and update its own kanban task block.
- Every background Agent must update `kanban.md` with status, Result, Files, Verification, and Updated before reporting back.
- Every task is accepted by its publisher: the Agent named in `From` reviews the completed task and fills `Review`.
- Squad Lead owns mission-level acceptance. If the overall result is below expectation, publish new focused tasks to the responsible Agents instead of editing another Agent's completed result.
- If a task is outside an Agent's scope and the correct owner is clear, reassign it in `kanban.md` with the reason in `Updated`.
- If task ownership is unclear, publish a clarification task to the Squad Lead.
- Use `roundtable.md` for decisions that affect multiple Agents, shared interfaces, mission scope, product direction, sequencing, acceptance criteria, or major risk trade-offs.
- Review Done tasks before declaring the Mission complete.

## Prompt Requirements For Background Agents

Every background Agent prompt must include:

- Mission name.
- Agent name and responsibility.
- The exact current task block.
- Scope boundary.
- Requirement to read Mission files.
- Requirement to claim, update, and complete its own task block in `kanban.md`.
- Requirement to self-test before moving the task to `Done`.
- Requirement to leave `Review` for the task publisher.
- Reassignment and Squad Lead clarification rules for responsibility mismatch.
- Statement that this is the first/current task, not all future work.
- No external A2A or Mexus dependency.

## Output

After creating the Mission, tell the user:

- Mission name.
- Files created or reused.
- Previous Missions archived, if any.
- Execution Agents planned and the kanban tasks published for them.
- The board URL (reused or newly started).
- Background Agents dispatched for the first task batch.
